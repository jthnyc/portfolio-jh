            Hey there! I'm Joanna and I enjoy creating pixel perfect things for
            the web. As a former teacher, I saw there was a gap between how
            educational software was meant to be used and how it's actually used
            in the classroom. Born out of a desire to bridge that gap, I set out
            to hone my skills as a developer and coded my first function to loop
            over an array as part of my application to Flatiron School's Mobile
            Dev Corps to learn iOS Development via Swift.

            Upon graduation, there was an immediate need at a music education
            startup I previously interned at. As their mission aligned with my
            interests, I transitioned to business development while still coding
            on the side. Fast forward two years later, my aspiration to be a
            better developer prompted me to take a deep dive into full stack web
            development through Fullstack Academy's Grace Hopper program in
            2020.

            I've had the privilege of working at the Born group since the start
            of 2021. My main focus at this time is building accessible and
            bespoke digital experiences for our clients.
          </p>
          <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
